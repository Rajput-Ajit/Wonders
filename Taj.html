			Taj Mahal-India
		</h1>
		<p style="text-align:justify;font-size:20px;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;">
			The Taj mahal was build by the Mughal Emperor shah jahan in memory of his favourite wife, mumtaj mahal.
			Construction began in 1632 and was completed in 1653.
		
		
			The <b>Taj mahal</b> is a prime example of mugal archetecture, which combines elements of persian, turkish , indian and 
			islamic architectural styles.
		<br><br>
			The main structure is made of white marble quarried from makrana in rajasthan. The intricate designs and patterns
			on the marble are created using precious and semi-precious stones.
		
		
			The taj mahal is often considered a symbol of eternal love. the story behind its construction reflects the deep 
			affection and grief of emperor shah jahan for his wife mumtaj mahal, who died during chilbirth.
		
		
			The taj mahal is known for its perfect symmetry. The four minarets surrounding the main mausoleum are
			intentionally build slightly outward to create an optical illusion. This ensures that they appear straight when 
			from a distance.
		<br><br>
		
			The color of taj mahal changes throught the day, appearing pinkish in the morning, milky white in the evening, and golden under the 
			moonlight. This is due to the changing sunlight and the reflective properties of the marble.
		
			The taj mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 in recognition of its cultural 
			significnace and outstanding universal value.
